            This initiative was launched by the Class of 1990 during their Silver Jubilee Reunion of 2015 in partnership with the institute. The innovation center would be unique as it would be operated around-the-clock on all days.
            
            The Class of 1990 provided funds for equipment and interiors for the center in collaboration with the institute, enabling students to collaborate across branches and tap into the knowledge of faculty and alumni to make their projects practical.
